integration vs solving an ODE numerically

identifiability analysis (practical, theoretical,...)

Fitting SDEs to data

can you learn from the wiggles? estimating kinetic parameters from mean _and_ variance (higher moments)


how many moments do you need to disentangle a mixture of gaussians? of distributions from any family? Are moments even the right statistic to compute from a sample?

how do floats work?

multiplying and dividing pdfs / RVs

estimating probability densities by kernel density estimation

logarithms are scalar multiples of one another

table of concentrations to copy number per cell (just multiply by the volume of a typical cell). Variance as a function of cell size?





mutual information of continuous variables
how do you evaluate mutual information between two continuous sets, with relatively sparse observations?

"The name of the wind": PDE visualizations, and how you can describe these phenomena

How do you make a spline that fits some points? You have constraints on the derivatives. Do you just solve a linear system?
